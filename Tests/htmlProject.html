        Lyrics

    <p>
    <pre>
        I was running out in the cold light,
        Wondering where to go
        To run away, without you
        All my fear is coming home,
        And it's ripped out for the show
        You can't be me,
        I will become you, tonight
        I was wandering under black skies,
        Clutching at what is mine
        No control, left to lose
        When I felt that it wouldn't phase me,
        I ran and hid like a child
        I feel so guilty,
        I'll make it up to you, tonight
        They're changing my future
        Visions I had buried underground,
        Return us our futures
        I was breaking out of my own skin,
        Choking upon release
        I'm in no state, to judge you
        Scratching itches best left alone,
        Chasing memories I used to own
        I can't wait until this is over, tonight
        They're changing my future
        Visions I had buried underground,
        Return us our futures
        Well the nightmares I've been having have arrived,
        They're changing my future
        Signs of my creation at my door,
        How could you do this to her?

    Fly me to the moon
    And let me play among the stars
    Let me see what Spring is like
    On Jupiter and Mars

    In other words
    Hold my hand
    In other words
    Darling kiss me

    Fill my heart with song
    And let me sing for ever more
    You are all I long for
    All I worship and adore

    In other words
    Please be true
    In other words
    I love you

    <p><em>
            <pre>
    My mind's this cave
    So dark, no moon, no stars
    No sound, just hearts and walls of art
    
    Strange things happen
    For no reason
    That's all I know
    My mind's this cave
    So dark, no moon, no stars, no stars
    No sound, just hearts and walls of art
    
    These creatures I've seen
    Some of them edible, some of them mean
    That's all I know
    I'm not like you
    You fly
    You burn my eyes, my eyes
    You speak in my mind
    Your kind all died when you arrived
    
    I saw you making fire
    Strange things happen for no reason at all
    
    I can't help you
    You're not human
    You're not animal
    My mind's this cave
    So dark, no moon, no stars, no stars
    No sound, just hearts and walls of art
    And you, you fly
    You burn my eyes
    You speak in my mind
    You seem surprised that I don't hear you
